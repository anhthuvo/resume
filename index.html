            I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Materials Engineering in
            December, 2019. In my curriculum, there are some courses relating to
            Math and programming (I highlighted in my transcript) and I did a
            lot of assignments with MATLAB programming during university time.
            That is where my passion for programming comes from. Therefore,
            after I graduated, I decided to pursue my career as a software
            developer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Until now, I have 2.5 year-experience on Front-end web app
            development. I mainly work on building the front-end of e-commerce
            websites and support the Backend team to develop RESTful API on
            demand. During this time, I realize that my knowledge is limited by
            the projects and position at the company I worked for. I love my job
            however, I am eager to broaden my perspective and prepare myself for
            the future.
            <br />
            <br />
            Because of that I decided to take a Master's program to meet and
            learn from the people who love programming like me. I am especially
            interested in machine learning because the influence of machine
            learning can be seen in everything. With the information explosion I
            believe that machine learning will flourish even more in the future
            so there is no reason that I don't prepare myself for that.
            <br />
            <br />
            The projects in <b>Interactive Computing Lab</b> strongly interested
            me when I was seeking a research assistant job. I read ICLab Winter
            2023 Interns - Topics and I found that project
            <b>Smart Home IoT: Sensing for Family Health</b> is the one that I
            most desired to work on. Because the domain project is meaningful in
            a stressed society like nowaday and family is the most important
            thing to me. Moreover, the project requires web development skills
            which I have experience on so I would be helpful. Currently I still
            lack machine learning skills but I am learning from the basics. I am
            studying a course series of Andrew NG and I will try to learn fast
            to catch up with the project if you can give me the opportunity to
            join.
