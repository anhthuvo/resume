          <p>Dear Prof. Lee</p>
          <p>
            My name is Thu. I am from Vietnam. I graduated with a bachelor’s
            degree in Materials Engineering in October, 2019. In my curriculum,
            there are some courses relating to Math and programming, which are
            highlighted in my transcript and I did a lot of assignments with
            MATLAB and C programming during university time. That is where my
            passion for programming comes from. Therefore, after I graduated, I
            decided to pursue my career as a software developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Until now, I have 2.5 year-experience on Front-end web app
            development. I have mainly worked on building the front-end of
            e-commerce websites and supporting the Backend team to develop
            RESTful API on demand. During this time, I realize that my knowledge
            is limited but the market has higher requirements. Therefore, I am
            eager to broaden my perspective and prepare myself for the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of that I decided to take a Master's program to meet and
            learn from the people who love programming like me. I am especially
            interested in machine learning because the influence of machine
            learning can be seen in everything. With the information explosion I
            believe that machine learning will flourish even more in the future
            so there is no reason that I don't prepare myself for that.
          </p>

          <p>
            The projects in <b>Interactive Computing Lab</b> strongly interested
            me when I was seeking a research lab. I read ICLab Winter 2023
            Interns - Topics and I found that project
            <b>Smart Home IoT: Sensing for Family Health</b> is the one that I
            most desired to work on. Project domain is meaningful and it
            includes machine learning tasks like Real-Time Facial
            Expression Recognition Using Webcam, family member's activities
            classification and time calculation..., which interests me.
            Moreover, the project requires web development skills which I have
            experience on so I would be helpful for that or any project that
            needs web development skills. Currently I still lack machine
            learning skills but I am learning from the basics. I am studying a
            course series of Andrew NG named Machine Learning Specialization and
            I will try to learn fast to catch up with the project if you can
            give me the opportunity to join.
